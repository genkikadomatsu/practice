# Practice Problems
Personal repository of practice problems and algorithm implementation examples in common programming languages.
* The point of this practice is
* (1) to learn good practices with widely used languages and
* (2) to become language agnostic and adaptable.

## Files in this repository: 
* Examples - These are example implementations (of well known algorithms) in common programming languages.
* [NeetCode150](https://neetcode.io/) - These problems are sourced from NeetCode. Most problems match the solutions provided by NeetCode, with small modifications for readability or preference.

## Languages and Style
Source code should align with these style guidelines, with the exception of abnormally heavy commenting for explanation.
* Python - Should follow PEP and reStructuredText style/formatting.
* C
* Rust
* TypeScript
* Kotlin (?)
